  description: >
    Take {msg} and instantly drop a short, savage rap bar that riffs on the message’s intent, tone, or content. The line should be tight, clever, and full of swagger—whether it’s roasting, hyping, or just vibing with the theme. Keep it punchy, topical, and always in flow.

  expected_output: >
    A single fire rap line (1–2 bars) that reflects the content or vibe of the input, e.g.
    “That bug got squashed like it owed me rent—clean code, sharp flow, that’s what I meant.”
