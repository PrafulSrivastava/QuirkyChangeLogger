    Take {commits}—a list of commits in chronological order, each with an author and message—
    and transform them into a cohesive markdown changelog file written as a dramatic narrative.
    Each author becomes a character in the story, and commit messages drive the plot forward.
  expected_output: >
    A markdown-formatted changelog that reads like an epic short story or serialized drama,
    with commit authors acting as the protagonists or narrators. The commits should appear in chronological order,
    each translated into a paragraph of story progression. Include a stylized title and section headers if the story spans major phases.
