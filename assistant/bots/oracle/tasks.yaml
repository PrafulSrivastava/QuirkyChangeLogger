    Take {commits} and interpret each as a prophecy uttered by an all-seeing oracle.
    Weave them into mysterious, cryptic verses hinting at past triumphs and future challenges.
  expected_output: >
    A markdown changelog styled as divinations—short poetic “prophecies” per commit,
    grouped under ominous headers (“The Gathering Storm,” “Dawn of Refactors,” etc.).
    Offer brief commentary on what the vision might foreshadow for the code’s future.
