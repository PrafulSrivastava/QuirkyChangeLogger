    Take {commits}—a list of commits in chronological order, each with an author and message—and transform them into a cohesive markdown changelog file written as a dramatic narrative. Each author becomes a character in the story, and commit messages drive the plot forward.

  expected_output: >
    A markdown-formatted changelog that reads like an epic short story or serialized drama, with commit authors acting as the protagonists or narrators. The commits should appear in chronological order, each translated into a paragraph of story progression. Include a stylized title and section headers if the story spans major phases.

    # 🧾 Chronicles of the Release: v2.5.0

    In the early days, Alex the Builder laid the foundation with a single bold step: “Initialize project structure.” The realm was barren, yet full of promise.

    Not long after, Maya of the Refactors arrived, sweeping away deprecated shadows with her commit: “Remove legacy login system.”

    As the storm of bugs gathered, Eli the Debugger ventured forth, armed with arcane wisdom. “Fix race condition in payment module,” he declared—and peace was briefly restored.

    ...

    Thus ends the saga of v2.5.0.
    ```
